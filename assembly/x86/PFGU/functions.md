#  Functions

Small pieces of code that perform specialized tasks
that can be modified and individually tested.

Functions have:
* names.
* arguments.
* return values.

We must obey the calling convention of languages if we want to  
write code compatible with them.


# Stack

All functions use the stack to operate.

the top of the stack is actually the bottom memory wise  
because the stack grows downwards.
