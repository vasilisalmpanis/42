Presentation Structure:
1. Introduction (30-45 seconds)
	Start with your introduction:
	Name, your role as an intern, and your school (42 Wolfsburg).
	Briefly introduce CloudLinux and the KernelCare team.
	Context of the company:
	Mention CloudLinux's focus: stability, security, and performance of servers for web hosting and enterprises.
	Introduce KernelCare as a leading live-patching solution for Linux servers, ensuring seamless security updates without rebooting.
	Show your enthusiasm and personal goal: “I was thrilled to gain hands-on experience in live-patching and kernel development.”

2. Company Context (1 minute)
	CloudLinux’s Market Role:
	CloudLinux is a trusted name in the Linux ecosystem.
	KernelCare: A flagship product for live-patching Linux kernels, focusing on enterprise-grade security.
	Importance of live patching in reducing downtime and addressing vulnerabilities in real-time.
	Highlight the stakes: Servers running critical workloads cannot afford downtime, so KernelCare solves a crucial problem.

3. Internship Challenges and Scope (1-2 minutes)
	Your Role in the KernelCare Team:
	Explain what backporting is (for non-technical viewers): Adapting patches for older Linux kernels to fix vulnerabilities.
	Mention how backporting fits into the broader live-patching process.
	Key Responsibilities:
	Adapting patches:
	Analyzed upstream kernel patches.
	Modified and tested them for compatibility with older kernel versions.
	Testing your changes rigorously:
	Created virtual machines.
	Booted kernels you patched to test for stability.
	Used tools like iperf to stress-test network subsystems.
	Loaded and unloaded kernel modules to simulate real-world scenarios.
	Ensuring patching/unpatching didn’t break the system:
	Used KernelCare’s engine to validate the live-patching process.
	Emphasize the technical and problem-solving aspects of your work.

4. Results and Learnings (1 minute)
	Results of Your Work:
	Delivered patches that were successfully integrated into KernelCare’s updates.
	Helped maintain secure environments for servers across multiple organizations.
	Reduced turnaround time for addressing vulnerabilities in older kernel versions.
	Skills You Developed:
	Technical: In-depth knowledge of Linux kernel internals, backporting techniques, and live-patching processes.
	Soft skills: Problem-solving, attention to detail, and the ability to rigorously test under pressure.

5. Conclusion (30-45 seconds)
	Reflect on your experience:
	“This internship not only deepened my technical expertise but also taught me the importance of reliability and precision in software engineering.”
	Thank the KernelCare team and CloudLinux for the mentorship and opportunity.
	End on a professional note: “I’m excited to take these skills forward into my career as a software engineer and contribute to innovative solutions like KernelCare.”
